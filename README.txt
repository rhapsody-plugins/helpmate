= AI Chatbot with Knowledgebase =
**Helpmate’s** AI chatbot is designed to do what most human agents can’t — respond instantly and accurately, 24/7. Built with a customizable knowledgebase, it can answer frequently asked questions, product-related queries, and policy concerns without breaking a sweat. Whether customers ask about delivery times, return policies, or sizing details, the Chatbot retrieves answers you’ve trained it on.
And the best part? You stay in full control. You can add, edit, and organize responses under categories to keep things neat.
No coding, no steep learning curve. It’s like having your best support agent always available, never tired, and never on break. Plus, if the Chatbot doesn’t know the answer, it can automatically hand the query over to a human — no awkward dead-ends for your users. That’s smart automation with a human touch.

= Product Suggestions in Chat =
Imagine a support chat that doesn’t just answer questions — it sells for you. **Helpmate’s** product suggestion engine works in real time to recommend relevant WooCommerce products based on the user’s query. Someone types “I need a waterproof bag”? Boom — your best-selling waterproof backpacks appear instantly, complete with image, name, and price.
The AI scans keywords from the conversation and maps them against your product catalog. It’s like giving your visitors a personalized shopping assistant, without hiring extra staff. You can even fine-tune the algorithm by feeding products data to the Chatbot. It’s a subtle but powerful way to increase average order value while delivering a smoother customer experience.

= Order Tracking by ID, Email, or Phone =
The days of "Where is my order?" emails are over. **Helpmate** offers a seamless self-service experience by letting customers track their WooCommerce orders using just an email, phone number, or order ID. No logins. No portal hopping. Just ask the chatbot, and it pulls live order data instantly. This drastically reduces support tickets and response times.
Plus, it's privacy-conscious — only showing data when valid credentials match the order. It’s fast, secure, and incredibly user-friendly. More clarity for your customers. Less work for your team.

= Abandoned Cart Recovery =
Every abandoned cart is lost revenue — but **Helpmate** helps get it back. The plugin tracks users who leave without checking out and sends personalized follow-up emails with cart contents, product images, and optional discount codes.
Unlike generic cart recovery tools, **Helpmate** ties it all together with real-time conversations and smart order tracking. Result? More carts recovered, more revenue retained.

= Search Product by Image =
Text-based search can only go so far. **Helpmate** gives your shoppers the power to search by uploading an image. A customer sees a product they like on social media? They snap a screenshot, upload it in the chat, and **Helpmate** instantly returns visually similar items from your store.
Powered by AI image recognition, this feature helps eliminate guesswork and bridges the gap between inspiration and purchase. It’s especially valuable for fashion, home décor, or lifestyle stores where visual appeal drives buying decisions. Not only does it wow your users, but it also reduces bounce rates by helping them find exactly what they want—faster.

= Proactive Sales Offers =
**Helpmate** isn’t just reactive — it knows how to sell proactively. It pops up your discounted product in chat window. These sales nudges feel helpful rather than pushy, because they’re context-aware. You can show only discounted products in chat window.
The goal? Catch buyers at the moment of indecision and give them a compelling reason to act. It’s one of the fastest ways to improve on-site conversion rates — and you won’t need to touch a single line of code.

= Live Sales Notifications =
Social proof sells — and **Helpmate** makes it real-time. The plugin can show live sales notifications like “Jessica in Dallas just bought this product”. These alerts create urgency and build buyer confidence without being intrusive. You can fully customize the look, timing, and frequency of notifications to match your brand.
Want it to show only verified purchases? Done. These subtle cues tap into FOMO (fear of missing out) and help push the hesitant buyer closer to checkout. And unlike many plugins that feel spammy, **Helpmate’s** alerts are lightweight and UX-friendly.

= Ticketing System Integration =
Sometimes, a conversation needs to go deeper than chat. **Helpmate** comes with a built-in ticket escalation system that captures customer queries when your team is offline or when the chatbot reaches its limit. The chatbot politely collects details like issue type, order ID, and contact info — then logs them into your ticket system (or sends to email).
No lost messages. No frustrated users. This ensures that when you or your support agents jump in later, you’ve already got context.

= Refund and Return via Chat =
Handling returns and refunds can be a hassle — both for customers and your team. **Helpmate** streamlines the process by allowing users to initiate refund or return requests directly in the chat.
It’s a game changer for stores with high volume or seasonal spikes. Best of all, it helps turn a potentially negative experience into a smooth, professional one. Customers appreciate transparency and speed — and you keep operations efficient.

= Smart Coupon Delivery =
Coupons convert — no question about it. But timing and context are everything. **Helpmate** takes coupon automation to a new level with smart triggers that send codes exactly when users are most likely to convert. A customer looks hesitant? The Chatbot can offer a 10% off coupon.
Someone tries to exit the site? Cue an exit-intent popup with a time-limited discount. You can also allow users to request a coupon in the chat directly. Every coupon is personalized, delivered within context, and easily redeemed. **Helpmate** even tracks usage so you can see which promotions work best — and which need tweaking. Smart, simple, and sales-focused.

= Promo Bar =
Want to highlight a flash sale, limited-time offer, or shipping countdown? Use **Helpmate’s** built-in Promo Bar. It’s a sleek notification banner that appears at the top or bottom of your site, fully customizable with your own message, colors, icons, and CTA buttons. You can schedule it or trigger it only on certain pages.
Combine it with **Helpmate’s** chatbot and you get a complete campaign flow — like offering a free gift via Promo Bar and delivering the code via chat. It’s simple to set up and surprisingly effective at driving clicks and conversions.

= Lead Collection =
**Helpmate** turns conversations into conversions by collecting emails, names, and phone numbers — all inside the chat. You don’t need third-party popups or list-building tools. The chatbot can ask for contact details before answering certain questions, or offer exclusive deals in exchange for a quick opt-in. You control the logic.
Leads are saved in your WordPress dashboard. It’s lead generation without friction — just the way modern users prefer.

= Human Handover =
Chatbots are great, but sometimes people need a real person. **Helpmate** allows seamless human handover when users type things like “need help from a person.” The Chatbot instantly shows contact options — phone, WhatsApp, Messenger, or a direct link to your support ticket form.
You decide which channels to show. This feature builds trust, reduces friction, and ensures the user never feels trapped in an endless AI loop. It’s perfect for high-stakes queries or premium customer support tiers.

= View Trained Data =
**Helpmate** doesn’t just respond — it learns. With the View Trained Data feature, store admins can review the exact data used to train the AI chatbot. That means full transparency over what your Chatbot knows, how it answers, and where those answers come from. Whether you're pulling in FAQs, support documentation, or dynamic WooCommerce data, **Helpmate** keeps it organized and reviewable.
Want to update a specific response? Easy. You’re in control of the knowledgebase, so you can fine-tune messaging based on customer behavior, seasonal campaigns, or product changes — without retraining from scratch.
This feature gives you peace of mind and quality assurance. You can test replies, analyze gaps, and confidently roll out improvements. **Helpmate’s** AI isn’t a black box — it’s a customizable assistant you can audit anytime.

= See Chat History =
No more guessing what customers asked or how the Chatbot responded. With See Chat History, store owners and agents get a full log of past customer conversations — stored safely and organized by session.
This means you can track user questions, identify common pain points, and refine both bot behavior and store experience based on real data.
From support audits to lead qualification, chat history is a goldmine for optimization. You’ll uncover product demand trends, coupon performance insights, and even upsell opportunities — all from a single dashboard.
It’s more than logs. It’s business intelligence, disguised as customer support.
